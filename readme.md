Add keybindings to quickly switch the chat roll mode from any screen.
A notification will appear when the roll mode is changed using a keybind (can be disabled).

Using toggle mode will switch between Public and the mode desired.
Using set mode will force the mode to become active. This won't do anything if the mode is already active.

Keybinds can be set for:  
 - Toggle Self Roll Mode (Default Alt+S)
 - Toggle Private Roll Mode
 - Toggle Blind Roll Mode
 - Set Public Mode
 - Set Self Mode
 - Set Private Mode
 - Set Blind Mode
